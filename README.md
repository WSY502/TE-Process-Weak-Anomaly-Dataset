failure 1 exhibits a distinct critical feed ratio threshold. When the deviation in the A/C molar ratio remains below this threshold, the system maintains fundamental operational stability through self-regulation mechanisms. However, deviation effects persistently accumulate within the reaction system, separation unit, and control loops, manifesting as a pronounced progressive response characteristic. This is specifically evident in the significant time delay between the onset of feed ratio deviation and the emergence of observable fluctuations in system metrics. Variable changes during the process exhibit non-linear evolution patterns influenced by reaction kinetics and inter-unit coupling, rather than linear relationships. Initial deviations trigger subtle, highly concealed variable fluctuations that gradually manifest as pronounced anomalies only after cumulative amplification over time. These characteristics align closely with the core definition of weak anomalies. The cumulative effects before threshold crossing, progressive evolution, nonlinear responses, and time delays accurately simulate the elusive nature of weak anomalies in real industrial scenarios—anomalies that traditional threshold-based detection methods struggle to capture. This provides ideal operational conditions for generating high-fidelity weak anomaly data required for weak anomaly detection models.
